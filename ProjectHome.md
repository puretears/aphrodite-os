I created this project so that people interested in learning OS would have a place to come if they needed help. I try to keep my code simple! An absolute newbie to both C and assembly language should be able to go through the code, and have a pretty good idea of what's going on. If you're a hardcore OS kernel programmer, this site may be too simplistic, but if you're just starting out, I feel aphrodite has a lot to offer!
